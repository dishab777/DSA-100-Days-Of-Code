# 🚀 DSA 100 Days of Code (C Language)

Welcome to my 100-day journey into the heart of **Data Structures and Algorithms** using the C language. This repository serves as a daily log of my progress, code implementations, and conceptual notes.

## 📌 Project Goals
* Master fundamental and advanced data structures.
* Solve classic algorithmic problems to build logic.
* Write clean, memory-efficient C code.
* Stay consistent for 100 consecutive days.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C (C11/C17)
* **Compiler:** GCC
* **Debugger:** GDB / Valgrind (for memory leak detection)

## 📅 The Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations & Arrays (Days 1-20)
* [ ] Pointers & Memory Management (`malloc`, `free`)
* [ ] Time & Space Complexity (Big O)
* [ ] Array Operations (Insertion, Deletion, Rotation)
* [ ] Linear & Binary Search

### Phase 2: Linked Lists & Stacks/Queues (Days 21-40)
* [ ] Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists
* [ ] Stack implementation using Arrays & Linked Lists
* [ ] Queue, Circular Queue, and Deque
* [ ] Applications: Infix to Postfix, Balanced Parentheses

### Phase 3: Sorting & Recursion (Days 41-60)
* [ ] Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sort
* [ ] Merge Sort & Quick Sort (Divide and Conquer)
* [ ] Recursive logic (Tower of Hanoi, Fibonacci)

### Phase 4: Trees & Graphs (Days 61-85)
* [ ] Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees (BST)
* [ ] Tree Traversals (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)
* [ ] AVL Trees (Basics)
* [ ] Graph Representation (Adjacency Matrix/List)
* [ ] BFS & DFS Algorithms

### Phase 5: Hashing & Dynamic Programming (Days 86-100)
* [ ] Hash Tables & Collision Resolution
* [ ] Introduction to DP (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence)
* [ ] Final Project/Review

## 🚀 How to Run
To compile and run any code file (e.g., `main.c`):

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
